# Task-Management-App
This is a Java-developed application, which enables the user to create a to-do list with tasks and keep track of their work in a well-organized environment. This application is a simple to-do list which gives the user the opportunity to create a task, enter an ID of the task and describe what exactly the task is and to set an exact date when the task is due. The code uses a data format year-month-day. This is also a great app to let the user keep track of missed tasks. The program enables them to view all tasks, view the tasks only due today or view only the missed tasks. The user can also mark any task as completed at any time, or delete a task. 

For user-friendly environment, instructions are provided as well as input-validation. In case of enetering an unsupported format, the program lets the user know and allows them to continue with their wished action. A menu is also provided with options. There is an exit option at all times. 
For safety, encapsulation is used in the Task and TaskManagement classes. 

In conclusion, the program is a basic app, but it has a lot of options and can effectively be a to-do list of a person.
